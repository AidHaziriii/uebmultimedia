            <p>Bentley has a rich and illustrious history that dates back over a century. Founded by Walter Owen Bentley in 1919, the brand quickly established itself as a symbol of luxury, craftsmanship, and performance.</p>
            <p>The early years of Bentley were marked by innovative engineering and success in motorsports. In the 1920s, Bentley cars gained fame for their victories at prestigious racing events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. These victories solidified Bentley's reputation for exceptional performance and endurance.</p>

Under Rolls-Royce ownership, Bentley continued to thrive and develop its distinct identity, combining exquisite design, advanced technology, and handcrafted luxury.</p>
            <p>Throughout the decades, Bentley has remained at the forefront of automotive excellence, producing some of the most iconic and desirable luxury cars in the world.
